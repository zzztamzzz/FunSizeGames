# First game
Start simple
2D platformer?
I dont even like platformers.
A fighting game, now that's what I enjoy.
Potentially 2 plus player.
Keep it local, no need to introduce online multiplayer capabilities.
Make it a little bloody and quite an extensive amount of gore? (vfx update ig)
For now just go with punching and kicking lol.
Inspiration from Drunken Wrestlers :)
